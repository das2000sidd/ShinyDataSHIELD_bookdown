[["setup.html", "2 Setup 2.1 R packages 2.2 Install", " 2 Setup In this section, a list of all the R packages required to launch ShinyDataSHIELD is given. Following it, two methodologies to install them is provided. The recommended methodology is to install all the packages using R and launch the Shiny app from there. However, depending on the version of R and other variables that cant be contemplated on a case to case basis, the user might have problems installing the R packages, if that is the case, an alternative has been created using Docker. 2.1 R packages The packages that contain the main functionalities of ShinyDataSHIELD are the following. DSI: The DataSHIELD Interface (DSI) handles the connections to the databases. DSOpal: DSOpal is an extension of DSI to connecto to Opal servers. dsBaseClient: Implementation of the base package R functions to obtain non-disclosive returns from the Opal servers (Example: Base package function as.factor is implemented as ds.asFactor). dsOmicsClient: Functions to perform non-disclosive omic analysis using BioConductor packages on the Opal servers. On the following table, all the packages required by ShinyDataSHIELD are shown along the versions used during development. Package Version DSI 1.1.0 DSOpal 1.1.0 dsBaseClient 6.0.1 dsOmicsClient 1.0.0 shinydashboard 0.7.1 shiny 1.4.0.2 shinyalert 1.1 DT 0.13 data.table 1.12.8 shinyjs 1.1 shinyBS 0.61 shinycssloaders 0.3 shinyWidgets 0.5.4 stringr 1.4.0 2.2 Install 2.2.1 Install packages with R In order to install the packages, an R console is needed. The simplest way to get it is to install R and RStudio, launch RStudio and start typing commands to the R console. RStudio console To install the required packages input the following commands to the console: # Install devtools install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) # Install required packages to run ShinyDataSHIELD devtools::source_url(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isglobal-brge/ShinyDataSHIELD/master/installer.R&quot;) # Install ShinyDataSHIELD devtools::install_github(&quot;isglobal-brge/ShinyDataSHIELD&quot;) The previous commands will install a library called devtools that is needed to source online scripts and run them. The next line sources a file that installs all the required packages to run ShinyDataSHIELD, finally the package that contains the Shiny application itself is installed.  Observation 1 The previous methodology has been tested on a clean installation of R 4.0.3 and RStudio 1.3, if any errors occur please consider using a clean install or refer to the official R documentation regarding the errors you are getting. Also, there is a known bug when using R 4.0.0 and Shiny, install R 4.0.3 or higher to solve it.  Observation 2 Please note that if you are using a Linux machine, the library libxml2 needs to be installed before trying to install the R packages, on a Ubuntu distribution it can be installed with sudo apt-get install libxml2, for other distributions please refer to the official documentation of it. 2.2.1.1 Run the Shiny app Once all the packages are installed, ShinyDataSHIELD can be executed inputing the following command on the R console, which will launch the application on a new window. # Run ShinyDataSHIELD ShinyDataSHIELD::app() 2.2.2 Install with Docker Another option to use ShinyDataSHIELD is to install it using Docker. Docker can be installed on a Linux / Mac OS X machine without any complications as any other application, on Windows systems however it can be a little bit more troubling, there are many online resources to help. Please refer to the following links to install Docker on Windows Home, to setup the Linux Windows Subsystem and terminal and to execute Docker on Windows. Once Docker is up and running, execute the following command on a bash terminal (make sure Docker is running, if not search for the Docker Desktop app and launch it) to download and launch ShinyDataSHIELD. Be aware that the Docker images weights ~ 1.5 GB, so if your internet connection is slow it may take a while. docker run --rm -p 80:80 brgelab/shiny-data-shield The container will be exposed on the local port 80 and it will render on that port the application itself, so to start using ShinyDataSHIELD open your web browser of choice and go to the site localhost:80 At the beginning it may take some time for the application to render, this is because all the needed R libraries are being loaded, to be sure the container is actually working, take a look at the terminal where you inputed the Docker command, there you will see all the R verbose stating the libraries are being loaded. Once the user has finished using ShinyDataSHIELD, the container needs to be stopped to avoid wasting CPU resources, to do so, input the following command on a bash terminal (the command needs to be inputed on a new bash window): docker container ls This will prompt all the running containers, find the one with the NAMES brgelab/shiny-data-shield and copy its CONTAINER ID, then input the following bash command: docker stop xxxxxxxxxxxx Where xxxxxxxxxxxx is the CONTAINER ID. To run the application again, just enter the first bash command (docker run --rm -p 80:80 brgelab/shiny-data-shield), since it has already been downloaded, the application is cached on the computer and it will launch straight away. If the user wants to remove the Docker image from the computer, input the following bash command: docker image rm brgelab/exposome-shiny If the user wants to download the actual source code of the Shiny, install all the required packages and launch it locally on its machine, feel free to download it from Github. Theres a script called installer.R at the root of the repository with a short installer of all the required packages. Please note that the installer script may fail depending on the R version and others, for that reason is advised to always run the Docker version of ShinyDataSHIELD, as it only requires a single terminal command and will work no matter what.
