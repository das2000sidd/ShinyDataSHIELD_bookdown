# Setup

In order to download and setup the environment to launch ShinyDataSHIELD, the latest version of the software has to be downloaded from GitHub. To do so, open a new RStudio session and run the following code on the console.

```{r setup_chunk_1}
  # Set working directory
setwd(dir = "/some/path/")

  # Download zip
download.file(url = "https://github.com/isglobal-brge/ShinyDataSHIELD/archive/master.zip", destfile = "master.zip")

  # Unzip the .zip to the working directory
unzip(zipfile = "master.zip")

  # Set the working directory inside the downloaded folder
setwd(dir = "/some/path/ShinyDataSHIELD-master")
```

Now all the source files are downloaded to the location chosen and the working directory moved to the correct folder, to start the project, open the `Rproj` file by clicking it on the Files explorer of RStudio.

Once the project is loaded, the file found on the source folder called `installer.R` has to be sourced and run. This will install the newest versions of the packages required by ShinyDataSHIELD on this R session. To do so, run the following code on the RStudio console.

```{r}
source("installer.R")
```

This is only needed on the first run, once completed it doesn't need to be done prior to launching the application itself any other time.

Now everything is ready to launch the Shiny application. To do so there a two approaches, one is to open the `ui.R` or the `server.R` files that are inside the `R` folder and press `Run App`.

The other option is to input the following command on the RStudio console.

```{r}
shiny::runApp('R')
```
